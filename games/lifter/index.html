                    Lifter is a project I have been thinking about creating for awhile now. 
                    It touches a bit on my child hood with some of the crazy things my friends 
                    and I use to do. Some of the inspiration was taken from a game an old friend 
                    made in pascal. My hope is I can provide the same enjoyment I got out of the 
                    original game with a more modern touch.

                <p>

                    Every job presents unique challenges, requiring a mix of stealth, agility, and wit. Unlock gadgets and skills to outsmart store employees, disable security, and disappear into the shadows.

                    As time ticks down toward your eviction date, the pressure mounts. Will you pay off your debts honorably, or will your actions create consequences you can’t outrun? In Lifter, survival isn't just about what you steal—it's about what you stand for.
